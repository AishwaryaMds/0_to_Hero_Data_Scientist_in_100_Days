- **Python**  
- **Machine Learning**  
- **Deep Learning**  
- **Power BI**  
- **MLOps**  
- **Azure**  
- And so much more!  

## 📂 **Repository Structure**  
This repository will be neatly organized into folders for each topic and daily progress. Here’s the example of the  structure:  
```plaintext
📁 SQL  
    ├── Day 1: Introduction to SQL, SELECT, WHERE  
    ├── Day 20: Advanced Joins and Subqueries  
📁 Python  
    ├── Day 5: Basics of Python  
    ├── Day 50: Data Visualization with Matplotlib
